Insurance Cost Prediction Project

Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict insurance costs based on personal attributes such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

Dataset Used
Name: Insurance Dataset
Source: Assumed to be `insurance.csv` (not explicitly provided)
Features: 
  - `age` (int): Age of the individual
  - `sex` (categorical): Male (0) or Female (1)
  - `bmi` (float): Body Mass Index
  - `children` (int): Number of children
  - `smoker` (categorical): Yes (0) or No (1)
  - `region` (categorical): Southeast (0), Southwest (1), Northeast (2), Northwest (3)
Target: `charges` (float): Insurance cost in USD
Size: 1338 rows, 7 columns

 Model Chosen
Model: Linear Regression
Reason: Suitable for continuous target variables like insurance costs and provides interpretable results.

## Performance Metrics
-Training R² Score: 0.7515 (indicating 75.15% variance explained)
- Testing R² Score: 0.7447 (indicating 74.47% variance explained on unseen data)
- Interpretation: The model performs consistently on both training and test sets, suggesting good generalization with moderate predictive power.

## Challenges & Learnings
-Challenges: 
  - Limited feature set may not capture all factors affecting insurance costs.
  - Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship, which may oversimplify the problem.
- Learnings: 
  - Importance of encoding categorical variables for machine learning models.
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets helps evaluate model performance on unseen data.
  - R² score provides a clear metric for regression model evaluation.
