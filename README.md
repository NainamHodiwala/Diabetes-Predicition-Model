# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning pipeline that predicts whether a patient has diabetes using health-related attributes such as Glucose level, Blood Pressure, BMI, and more. It follows a modular and production-ready structure.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

- `Pregnancies`
- `Glucose`
- `BloodPressure`
- `SkinThickness`
- `Insulin`
- `BMI`
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`
- `Age`
- `Outcome` (1: Diabetic, 0: Non-diabetic)

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle - Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) or place it in the `data/` folder as `diabetes.csv`.
